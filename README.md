# Assignment-02
This is the second assignment for BIOL390: Reproducible Research in the summer of 2020. The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with the basic functions of git and GitHub. 
1) You will make a personal copy of this project by forking the repo. 
2) You should then clone the forked repo on your remote to your local machine. 
3) From there, you will make the requested changes to the Assigment-02.Rmd file and 
4) Commit those changes using git. 
5) Then push the changes up to your remote on GitHub. 
6) Finally, create a pull request to submit your altered fork to me.

If you can do all that, you will be well on your way to becoming proficient at version control using git and GitHub.
